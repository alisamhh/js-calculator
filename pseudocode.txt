    title: ELECTRONIC CALCULATOR (center)
    split into 4x6 grid
        row 1: calculation window
        row 2: AC, CE, %, /
        row 3: 7, 8, 9, *
        row 4: 4, 5, 6, -
        row 5: 1, 2, 3, +
        row 6: 0, ., =, + (starts in row 5)

// calculation window
    displays 9 digits
    displays a number, infinity, or NaN

// computations
    create empty array variable (entries)
    create variable set to 0 (total)
    create empty string variable (temp)
    associate each button with click event listener and assign value to variable (val)
    if val is a number or decimal point, add to temp and display in window
    else if val is AC, emptry entries array, temp string, and total. display nothing in window
    else if val is CE, emptry temp string and display nothing in window.
    else if val is x, add to temp to entries, add val to entries, clear temp.
    else if val is /, add to temp to entries, add val to entries, clear temp.
    else if val is =, add temp to entries, perform calculation
        create variable to store first item in entries array converted from string to number (nt)
        for second item in entries array
            create symbol variable to store that item
            create variable to store the nextNum which is the following item in array, converted to a number.
            if symbol is +, add nextNum to nt.
            else if symbol is -, subtract nextNum from nt.
            else if symbol is *, multiple nextNum times nt.
            else if symbol is /, divide nextNum by nt.
            add one to loop item in order for loop to increment by 2 to get the next symbol in array.
    don't understand the "swap -" part at the end

// reach goals
    press clear button, show 0, then make sure 0 doesn't start before the next number (also, )
    accept keyboard inputs instead of just mouse clicks
    don't allow multiple decimal points in the same entry
